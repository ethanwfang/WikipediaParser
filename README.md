# WikipediaParser
This program automatically builds a text document that is my own introduction to Operating Systems. It does this by taking the Wikipedia page for "operating system" and pursuing every linked term or phrase in a paragraph of text. It then takes the first paragraph of the linked page and inserts that text into the new document. <br>

There is still much to be improved to this script, but this was a good first introduction to HTML parsing using Python.
